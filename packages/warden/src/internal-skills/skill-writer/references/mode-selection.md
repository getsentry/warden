# Mode Selection

Choose the minimal set of paths needed for the request.
Regardless of path, prioritize input quality and coverage depth before finalizing outputs.
Do not add evaluation unless the user asks for it, the change is high-risk, or the architecture choice is genuinely uncertain.

## Path mapping

| Request shape | Required paths |
|---------------|----------------|
| New skill from scratch | synthesis + authoring + description optimization + registration/validation |
| Update existing skill wording/structure | authoring + description optimization + registration/validation |
| Improve skill from outcomes/examples | iteration + authoring + description optimization + registration/validation |
| Research-first skill planning | synthesis only, then authoring if requested |
| Risky, disputed, or explicitly reviewed change | add `evaluation` to the selected path |

## Skill class selection

Classify the target skill before synthesis. This determines the coverage dimensions that must be represented in sources, references, and validation.

| Skill class | Typical request shape | Required dimensions |
|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| `workflow-process` | repeatable operations, CI/task orchestration | preconditions, ordered flow, failure handling, safety boundaries |
| `integration-documentation` | library/framework integration, SDK usage, API correctness | API surface, config/runtime options, common use cases, known issues/workarounds, version/migration variance |
| `security-review` | vulnerability finding, exploitability review | vulnerability classes, exploit paths, false-positive controls, remediations |
| `skill-authoring` | creating/updating/evaluating other skills | source provenance, depth gates, transformed examples, registration/validation |
| `generic` | does not match above | explicit dimensions chosen and justified in synthesis |

When the class is ambiguous, ask one direct clarification question before synthesis.

## Execution shape selection

Choose the skill's primary execution shape separately from the skill class.
Class answers "what domain/problem is this skill for?"
Shape answers "how should this skill run?"

Use `references/execution-shapes.md` for the full decision table and the next leaf reference to load.

Record:

1. primary execution shape
2. simpler-shape rejection when the chosen shape is advanced
3. exact leaf references opened because of that choice

## Required outputs by path

- `synthesis`: source inventory, decisions, coverage matrix, gaps.
- `synthesis`: selected class, selected execution shape, and selected example profile path(s), including profile-requirement coverage.
- `synthesis`: simplicity rationale showing why the chosen shape is necessary and which simpler shapes were rejected.
- `synthesis`: portability note when provider-specific mechanics are used.
- `synthesis`: explicit retrieval stopping rationale showing why further collection is currently low-yield.
- `authoring`: updated `SKILL.md` and required supporting files.
- `description optimization`: should/should-not trigger sets and final description.
- `iteration`: example intake summary and behavior deltas.
- `evaluation`: qualitative summary and any deeper checks run.
- `registration/validation`: registration edits and validator results.

## Hard stop rules

Do not claim completion when any required path output is missing.
Evaluation output is required only when `evaluation` was selected.

For authoring/generator skills, missing transformed example artifacts is a hard failure.
Missing selected-profile requirements is also a hard failure.
Missing required class dimensions is a hard failure.
Missing an explicit execution-shape choice for a material skill change is a hard failure.
Using advanced mechanics without justification or portability notes is a hard failure.
