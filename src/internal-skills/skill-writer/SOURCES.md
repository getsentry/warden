## Decisions

1. `skill-writer` is a meta-router: it must choose both a skill class and an execution shape before authoring.
2. Default to the simplest adequate shape. Advanced mechanics require evidence and an explicit reason simpler shapes were rejected.
3. Skill class and execution shape are independent axes. Class drives coverage requirements; shape drives runtime mechanics and artifact layout.
4. `SKILL.md` remains the orchestration/index layer; references, scripts, assets, hooks, and subagents are leaves selected by that router.
5. Provider-specific Claude Code features are valuable but not default. Use them only when justified and record portability implications.
6. Claude-specific frontmatter guidance should track the current `code.claude.com/docs/en/skills` fields, including `when_to_use`, `arguments`, `effort`, `paths`, `shell`, `context`, `agent`, and `hooks`.
7. Router, parallel/orchestrator, evaluator-loop, subagent-fork, and hook-backed shapes each require explicit contracts, not just prose.
8. Hooks are deterministic enforcement and need narrow scope plus security notes because command hooks run with full user permissions.
9. Multi-agent guidance should distinguish manager/orchestrator, handoff, and isolated subagent execution instead of collapsing them into one pattern.
10. Reasoning-model guidance is a design option, not a universal default: planner/doer splits are useful when complexity warrants them.
11. Validation should check architectural choices qualitatively, not only file structure and prose depth.
12. Reference files remain split by lookup need rather than topic buckets, even as the set of supported shapes expands.
13. Subfolders inside `references/` are acceptable when they create clearer lookup leaves, but every bundled reference should still be directly discoverable from `SKILL.md`.
14. The validator should enforce durable structural guarantees and required fields, but should not hardcode provider-specific optional frontmatter keys.
15. `skill-writer` should default to dense structures such as tables, checklists, templates, and I/O examples, and should cut explanatory prose unless it prevents a concrete mistake.
16. `SKILL.md` should stay a thin router; repeated policy belongs in routed references rather than always-loaded step prose.
17. Evaluation is conditional and should not be part of the default authoring path unless the user asks for it or the change is genuinely risky.

## Open gaps

1. The validator still only partially checks advanced-shape contracts; deeper automated checks may be worth adding.
2. This repository still has few real shipped examples using `hooks`, `context: fork`, `when_to_use`, `arguments`, `paths`, or `effort`.
3. Public repo docs outside `skill-writer` may need follow-up updates to fully reflect the current Claude-specific skill fields.

## Changelog

- 2026-03-05: Initialized `SOURCES.md` with baseline source pack (local canonical, Codex upstream, Claude upstream, spec, and repo conventions).
- 2026-03-19: Clarified path-resolution guidance so bundled skill references stay skill-root-relative while registration steps are resolved from the repository's active layout.
- 2026-03-19: Made portability a default authoring rule and emphasized avoiding host-specific absolute filesystem paths.
- 2026-04-19: Updated path guidance to preserve repository-standard root variables such as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}` instead of banning them outright.
- 2026-04-19: Restored `.agents/skills` as the default authoring target and kept repository-specific layouts as an inspected override rather than the default.
- 2026-04-19: Added explicit prior-art inspection and user-confirmation guidance when the correct skill root is unclear.
- 2026-04-26: Added reference architecture, source discovery, and iteration evidence guidance; updated synthesis, authoring, and iteration paths to prevent overloaded `SKILL.md` and catch-all reference files.
- 2026-04-26: Added `SPEC.md` as the canonical `skill-writer` maintenance specification and added `references/spec-template.md` for future skills.
- 2026-04-26: Removed fixed integration reference filename validation and added length-based reference warnings.
- 2026-04-26: Reworked reference architecture around concrete lookup needs instead of generic topic buckets.
- 2026-05-01: Reworked `skill-writer` around explicit execution-shape routing, added shape-specific example profiles, refreshed Claude Code provider mechanics from current official docs, and added eval/source guidance for routing, delegation, hooks, and evaluator loops.
- 2026-05-01: Replaced generic pattern bucket references with routed leaf files under `references/artifact-layouts/`, `references/workflow-mechanics/`, and `references/claude-code/`; made `SKILL.md` enumerate every bundled reference file with a direct open-when reason.
- 2026-05-01: Removed the validator's hardcoded optional frontmatter allowlist so provider-specific field drift does not create noisy false warnings.
- 2026-05-01: Reduced prose-heavy guidance in `skill-writer`, rewrote the main runtime refs into denser tables/checklists, and made compact runtime guidance an explicit contract.
- 2026-05-01: Thinned `SKILL.md` back toward a true router, removed duplicated execution-shape detail from `mode-selection.md`, and made evaluation conditional instead of a default workflow path.
